This package contains a proof-of-concept implementation of the "New approach to proving hyperbolicity" algorithm.

===============

This is work-in-progress. There are probably many bugs, and places in which I did not understood

If you do play with it and find problems, let me know, file an issue, or send me an email, and I will
be happy to discuss.

This branch is an attempt at making the datastructures more appropriate
