    <Heading>The MAGMA-comatible interface</Heading>

    An implementation of the hyperbolicity testing algorithm and word-problem solver exist in MAGMA as well. For ease of comparison between the results these two systems give, &walrus; contains an interface that aims to be compatible with MAGMA's. Please refer to MAGMA's documentation for further details.
