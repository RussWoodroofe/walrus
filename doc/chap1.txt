  [33X[0;0YThis  package  provides  the  operations  [10XIsHyperbolic[110X,  ways  of  testing a
  finitely presented group for hyperbolicity (in the sense of Gromov).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  algorithm  is  based  on  ideas  by  Richard  Parker, and the theory is
  described in the paper "Polynomial time proofs that groups are hyperbolic".[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  main  function  of  this  package is the so-called RSym-tester. Given a
  (pregroup)  presentation of a group, this function will try to prove whether
  the group defined by the presentation is hyperbolic, and will give an answer
  in  polynomial  time.  Since hyperbolicity is undecidable, the answer can be
  positive,  negative,  or  inconclusive.  As  a  simple  example consider the
  following.  Triangle groups are known to be hyperbolic when the sum [22Xfrac1p +
  frac1q   +   frac1r[122X   is   less  than  [22X1[122X.  The  parameter  for  [2XIsHyperbolic[102X
  ([14X???IsHyperbolic???[114X) gives the algorithm a hint how hard it should try.[133X
