  This package provides the operations <C>IsHyperbolic</C>, ways of testing a
  finitely presented group for hyperbolicity (in the sense of Gromov).

  The algorithm is based on ideas by Richard Parker, and the theory is described
  in the paper "Polynomial time proofs that groups are hyperbolic".

      <Heading>Testing Hyperbolicity</Heading>

      The main function of this package is the so-called RSym-tester. Given a (pregroup) presentation of a group, this function will try to prove whether the group defined by the presentation is hyperbolic, and will give an answer in polynomial time.
      Since hyperbolicity is undecidable, the answer can be positive, negative, or inconclusive.

      As a simple example consider the following. Triangle groups are known to be hyperbolic when the sum <M>\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{r}</M> is less than <M>1</M>. The parameter for <Ref Func="IsHyperbolic" /> gives the algorithm a hint how hard it should try.
      <Example><![CDATA[
gap> triangle := TriangleGroup(2,3,7);
<pregroup presentation with 3 generators and 1 relators>
gap> IsHyperbolic(triangle, 1/6);
true
gap> triangle := TriangleGroup(3,3,3);
<pregroup presentation with 3 generators and 1 relators>
gap> IsHyperbolic(triangle, 1/6);
